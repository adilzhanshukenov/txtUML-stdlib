/*	An instance of this class is used to generate a stream of pseudorandom numbers. 
 *  The class uses a 48-bit seed, which is modified using a linear congruential formula. 
 *  (See Donald Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2, Section 3.2.1.)
 *	If two instances of Random are created with the same seed, and the same sequence of method calls is made 
 *	for each, they will generate and return identical sequences of numbers. In order to guarantee this property, 
 *	particular algorithms are specified for the class Random. Java implementations must use all the algorithms 
 *	shown here for the class Random, for the sake of absolute portability of Java code. However, subclasses of 
 *	class Random are permitted to use other algorithms, so long as they adhere to the general contracts for all 
 *	the methods.
 *	The algorithms implemented by class Random use a protected utility method that on each invocation can supply 
 *	up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits.
